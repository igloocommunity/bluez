  * Merge from debian experimental.  Remaining changes: (LP: #708770)
    - debian/bluetooth-dbus.conf:
      + Allow access to the D-Bus resource "org.bluez" also for the "lp"
        group so that the "bluetooth" CUPS backend can access when it is
        run by CUPS for discovery of Bluetooth printers.
    - debian/bluez.bluetooth.default:
      + Drop.  Doesn't do anything now.
    - debian/bluez.preinst:
      + Cleanup /etc/default/bluetooth as it's not used anymore.
    - debian/control:
      + Add udev to build-depends. Allows pkg-config to query udev data
        directory variable.
    - debian/rules:
      + Don't build hid2hci anymore.  It's part of udev now.
      + Don't install bluez_agent.udev, doesn't work in Ubuntu.
      + Drop simple-patchsys.mk
    - debian/source/format: Use source format 3.0.
    - debian/source_bluez.py, debian/bluez.install:
      + Apport hook made by Baptiste Mille-Mathias.
    - debian/bluez.bluetooth.init:
      + Drop most calls in this script as now all it serves as
        is to workaround a problem with dbus not being ready early
        enough. Once dbus is started by an upstart service, this
        should be able to be converted to an upstart service too.

  * Debian has adopted the Ubuntu bluez package.  Merge
    with debian packaging.  Remaining delta:
    - Drop 010_udev_rules_agent.patch.  Ubuntu doesn't have

      working.
    - Don't advertise hid2hci in bluetooth.default or bluetooth.init
    - Don't install bluez_agent.udev, doesn't work in Ubuntu.
  * New upstream version (4.41):
    - Multiple fixes for the audio subsystem
    - Makes the Bluetooth daemon itself more and more stable.
